# Lobe Model For GPUs
This is a simple Lobe model to detect GPU types (only NVIDIA). This project was made for STEM at my school.

## Usage
1. Create a venv
 - `python3 -m venv .venv`
 - `.venv\Scripts\activate`
2. Install requirements
 - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start the model
 - `py __main__.py`
